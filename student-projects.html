									<p>
									Funding is available for a PhD student to study time-varying earthquake phenomena and the interaction of earthquakes in New Zealand through the development of a world-class, scientifically relevant earthquake catalogue for New Zealand. This project will suit students with interests in earthquake physics, tectonics, modern computational methods and machine learning. The broad scope of this project will allow for the student to develop their own interests and foci as the project evolves. Given New Zealand’s diverse tectonics, the student may chose to focus on anything from the interactions between earthquakes and slow-slip, the structure of the New Zealand plate boundary, seismic hazard, seismicity associated with volcanism, or a myriad of other topics. The successful candidate is likely to have prior experience in scientific programming. Ideally the student would commence their study between May and October 2022.

									This project's scholarship provides a $27,500 annual stipend and tuition fees for three years as part of a Royal Society Te Apārangi Rutherford Discovery Fellowship held by Dr Calum Chamberlain.

								<h2>Structure, stress and earthquake interactions at New Zealand’s most seismically active plate boundary: the Puysegur subduction zone</h2>
								</div>
								<div class="image"><a href="#"><img src="images/SALSA_long_install.jpg" alt="Installation of one of the SALSA sites" /></a></div>
								<div class="content">

									<p>
									Funding is available for a PhD student to study structure, stress and earthquake interactions at the Puysegur subduction zone beneath Fiordland in southern New Zealand. The Puysegur subduction zone is a relatively young subduction zone and regularly produces moderate to large (M>5) earthquakes. Despite this seismicity and the tectonic significance of this system, the Puysegur subduction zone has received relatively little attention, mostly due to its remote nature.
									</p><p>
									The student working on this project will deploy and maintain a network of seismometers and semi-continuous GNSS stations throughout Fiordland, and use these data to develop a high-quality catalogue of earthquakes and slow-earthquakes. The student will then use these catalogues to study one or more of the following topics: subduction zone structure, stress state surrounding the subduction system, slow earthquakes, earthquake interaction, earthquake physics. This project will suit a student with interests in earthquake physics, tectonics and field methods. It will involve regular fieldwork in remote regions, utilising helicopters for access. We plan on deploying this network in the Austral summer 2022–2023, and ideally a student would start between December 2022 and July 2023.

								<h2>About VUW</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
							Victoria University of Wellington—Te Herenga Waka is ranked in the top 100 institutions worldwide in Earth and Marine Sciences (2022 QS rankings). In the most recent Performance-Based Research Fund (PBRF) quality evaluation of New Zealand universities, the University was ranked first in New Zealand for overall research intensity and for research in Earth Sciences and Geography. The Geophysics programme is globally renowned for research in seismology, volcano and crustal geophysics, and Antarctic geophysics.
							</p>

							<h3>How to Apply</h3>
							<p>
							We invite applications from students with a relevent qualification at either MSc level for PhD application, or BSc level for MSc project. Students should hold these qualifications or will obtain this qualification before commencing their study in a relevant topic, which may include geophysics, earth sciences, geology or data science. International applications are extremely welcome, and New Zealand’s COVID-19 related border restrictions are beginning to ease. However we advise students to visit the Victoria University of Wellington site on international applications (https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/fgr/apply/international) and to familiarise themselves with New Zealand’s pandemic-related travel restrictions.
							</p>
							<p>
							To apply, please first send an expression of interest by emailing a CV, academic transcript, and brief cover letter to Calum Chamberlain: <a href="mailto:calum.chamberlain@vuw.ac.nz">calum.chamberlain@vuw.ac.nz</a>.
