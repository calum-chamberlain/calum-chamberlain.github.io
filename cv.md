The following is a summary of some of the key things people seem to want to hear
about.  More interesting information is on the [research](/research/) page.

# Programming experience
My programming roots lie in fortran, having been taught this at University alongside
Matlab.  Since then my programming has branched out somewhat.  My language of
choice is Python, and I regularly add functional submodules and functions to my
[EQcorrscan](http://calum-chamberlain.github.io/EQcorrscan/)
Python package, which is distributed on both github and pypi.

I also have experience in c and c++, mostly for scientific algorithms.  I am starting
to gain experience writing html and css.  I prefer to work by command-line so have
a good knowledge of shell scripting.
